1. Write a react function that takes the following input:
rooms = [
    { room_type: "Queen", vacant_rooms: 5, price: 100 },
    { room_type: "Double", vacant_rooms: 3, price: 75 },
    { room_type: "Twin", vacant_rooms: 8, price: 60 }
  ];
And produces the following output:
<ol><li>Queen, 5, $100</li><li>Double, 3, $75</li><li>Twin, 8, $60</li></ol>

Ans:   
        getRoomInfo = (rooms) => {
            return (
                <ol>
                    {rooms.forEach(item =>{
                         return <li>{item.room_type}, {item.vacant_rooms}, ${item.price}</li>
                    })}
                </ol>
            )
        }
  
 
2. Write a function in Javascript, which receives NUMBER and has the next logic:
a) it prints "foo" if NUMBER is divisible by 2;
b) it prints "bar" if NUMBER is divisible by 7;
c) it prints "foobar" if NUMBER is divisible by 14;
d) it prints NUMBER value for other cases;
note: NUMBER is a positive integer number;

Ans:
        function checkDivisible(num){
            if(num%2===0){
                console.log("foo")
            }else if(num%7===0){
                console.log("bar")
            }else if(num%14===0){
                console.log("foobar")
            }else{
                return num
            }
        }
 
 
3. Let's say you have a file with a following structure:
"id,name,value
1,Dan,150
2,Peter,300
3,Mark,400
4,Victor,600"

Write a function in node.js that reads this file and returns the number, which is a sum of all "value" numbers from the file;

Ans:

        async function processLineByLine() {
          const fs = require('fs');
          const readline = require('readline');
          //assume the file path is input.txt
          const fileStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
          let sum = 0

          const rl = readline.createInterface({
            input: fileStream,
            crlfDelay: Infinity
          });

          for await (const line of rl) {
            console.log(`Line from file: ${line}`);
            let value = line.split(",")
            sum += parseInt(value.pop())
          }
          return sum
        }









4. Refactor the code below.
(do not create functions or constants, code refactor is required only)
 
if (province == 'ONTARIO') {
   rate = ONTARIO_RATE;
   amt = base * ONTARIO_RATE;
   calc = 2 * basis(amt) + extra(amt) * 1.05;
} else if ((province == 'QUEBEC') || (province == 'ALBERTA')) {
   rate = (province == 'QUEBEC') ? QUEBEC_RATE : ALBERTA_RATE;
   amt = base * rate;
   calc = 2 * basis(amt) + extra(amt) * 1.05;
   if (province == 'QUEBEC') {
       points = 2;
   }
} else {
   rate = 1;
   amt = base;
   calc = 2 * basis(amt) + extra(amt) * 1.05;
}

Ans: 
        const rates = {
            ONTARIO: 'ONTARIO_RATE',
            QUEBEC: 'QUEBEC_RATE',
            ALBERTA: "ALBERTA_RATE",
            OTHER_PROVINCE: 1
        }
        rate = rate[province]
        amt = base * rate;
        calc = 2 * basis(amt) + extra(amt) * 1.05;
        province == 'QUEBEC' ? points = 2 : ''



5. Write a small react or react native app that uses this weather api:
https://www.metaweather.com/api/ *
Your app should allow the user to search for a city and see that day's forecast.
Styling is not important, you can use default browser styles.

*Note: some people have reported that this API does not have CORS enabled on their server, in this case if you are having difficulty with CORS you can launch chrome with CORS disabled: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome or you can select a different API of your preference: https://rapidapi.com/category/Weather
